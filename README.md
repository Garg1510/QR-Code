# QR-Code

Generate QR Code using the python-qrcode module. Used OpenCV and then the imread () function to read the image from the directory and the QRCodeDectector() function to detect the QR code in the image. We have then used the detectAndDecode() function and printed the value for the users.
OpenCv Python also has multi-detection capabilities. Used numpy to duplicate the image and then checked using detectAndDecode() function if multiple qr codes are present
